###### Welcome to my Savvy Sandbox!

I built this up as part of my learning over the course of the TWP2 class, and I adapted some of it into my portfolio for the class demo. It's a bunch of code written as exercises and somewhat organized into a [website](https://clever-hearties.netlify.com/). Think of it as the mess of sketches from which a masterpiece is created!

Quick facts about me:
+ I like gardening
+ I love living in Chattanooga
+ I've enjoyed this project!

Fun fact: I enjoy tea tins. :)
